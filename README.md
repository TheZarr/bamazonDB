 <!-- Bamazon CLI App -->

<!--  Overview -->

This application has 2 different flows - client, and manager, I was not able to do the  supervisor one. 


<!-- Customer -->

here is hoping that the Customer will be able to see the inventory and make a purchase.

If there are no stock of a certain product then the customer should be notified



<!-- Manager -->

The manager should be able to 
    
  View the products for sale, View products that have a low inventory, Manage Inventory, Add to the Inventory, Add new products
